  <h3>🧐 About me</h3>
  <p>
    • Passionate about technology since 2018. I like to learn and update myself
    whenever I can.
  </p>
  <p>
    • I consider myself communicative and I believe that teamwork is not only
    necessary, but also the best way to obtain results.
  </p>
  <p>
    • As a software engineer, I constantly seek to improve myself and stay up to
    date with the best practices in software development; because I believe that
    before the technologies used come the solution.
